ORIGINAL DATA

Data from:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones:
"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

Data set tidy_data.txt
The dataset tidy_data.txt is the result of cleaning and selecting data from data from an experiment described above.
More information about the measurements in the raw dataset can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Here follows a description of what tidy_data.txt looks like.
1.	variable subject = subject number that performed an activity (total of 30 subjects)
2.	variable activity = activity performed by the subject. There are six activites:
•	WALKING
•	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
•	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
•	SITTING
•	STANDING
•	LAYING
The remaining columns contain the features from the data, but only the mean values, but have been renamed for more descriptive names:
•	The prefix t --> time
•	The prefix f --> freq
•	dashes and parentheses have been removed
•	BodyBody --> Body
•	CamelCasing has been applied to the names
